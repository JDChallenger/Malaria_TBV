# Malaria_TBV

This repository contains the scripts needed to generate the figures in the forthcoming publication 'Predicting the public health impact of a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine' by Challenger et al. (submitted to Nature Communications). A link to the paper will be added upon publication

The script 'oocyst_distn_tba.R' requires data that is stored on Dryad: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9p8cz8wfh. The collection of this data is described in the article by Bompard et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2020.05.012).

To run the scripts you'll need to download the [Imperial College Deterministic Malaria Model](https://github.com/mrc-ide/deterministic-malaria-model) package
